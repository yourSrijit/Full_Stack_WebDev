<!-- /**** EVENTS in JavaScript ****/


// HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
// When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events. -->
<!-- // Here are some examples of HTML events:

// An HTML web page has finished loading
// An HTML input field was changed
// An HTML button was clicked
// Often, when events happen, you may want to do something. -->

<!-- 
//  4 ways of writing Events in JavaScript

// 1: using inline events alert();
// 2: By Calling a funcion (We already seen and most common way of writing) 
// 3: using Inline events (HTML onclick="" property and element.onclick)
// 4: using Event Listeners (addEventListener and IE's attachEvent) -->
